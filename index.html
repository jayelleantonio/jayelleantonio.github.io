        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi! I'm Jayelle Antonio. Welcome to my website! A few things about me: I am a current student at the University of California, Riverside, majoring in Pre-Business with plans to concentrate in either Marketing or Management. Iâ€™m passionate about understanding how ideas, products, and strategies connect with consumers, and Iâ€™m working on building the skills to turn that interest into a career.

I was born and raised in the Bay Area, where diversity and innovation thrive. That environment helped shape the way I think about business and sparked my interest in how brands connect and engage with their audiences. What really drew me to business, though, was marketingâ€”especially product marketing. Iâ€™m interested in how companies launch products that resonate with people and become part of their everyday lives. Long-term, I hope to work in the beauty industry, where I can help bring products to the market and be part of shaping the way beauty brands connect with their customers.

At UCR, Iâ€™ve been working on building a strong foundation in key business areas through my classes. As I move closer to selecting my concentration, Iâ€™m excited to dig deeper into areas that blend strategy and creativityâ€”like digital marketing, consumer behavior, and leadership. Iâ€™m eager to apply what Iâ€™m learning to real-world settings and start building experiences that will prepare me for a future career in beauty marketing after graduation.

Outside of my academic life, I enjoy staying creative in my own way. In my free time, you can usually find me working on hands on projects like doing my own nails or crocheting. These hobbies give me a chance to take a break from school and express myself. They remind me how rewarding it is to create and bring ideas to life, whether itâ€™s through a nail design or a handmade crochet piece.

Looking ahead, Iâ€™m excited to take on new opportunitiesâ€”whether itâ€™s through internships, group projects, or leadership rolesâ€”that will help me grow both personally and professionally. My goal is to combine my business knowledge with my creative interests in a way that lets me make a meaningful impact, especially in an industry I care about as much as beauty.

This website is a place where you can learn more about me, my academic background, and my experiences so far. Youâ€™ll find my resume, details about my education, and highlights from projects and roles Iâ€™ve taken on along the way. Thank you so much for taking the time to visit and Iâ€™d love to connect with you as I continue my journey to achieving my career goals.<br><br>
